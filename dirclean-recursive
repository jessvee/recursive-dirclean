#Usage: dirclean [--test] ROOT_DIRECTORY FILENAME_PATTERN...

#Matches FILENAME_PATTERN against files in ROOT_DIRECTORY and deletes them.
#Multiple filename patters can be given. This is a recursive version. It does
#go into subdirectories.

#If --test option is used, dirclean will find the files matching the pattern and
#print them out for review. Nothing will be deleted.

#1 basic error checking for correct number of arguments in the call:
if [[ $# -lt 2 ]]; then
	echo "Usage: dirclean [--test] ROOT_DIRECTORY FILENAME_PATTERN..."
	exit 1
fi

#2 deterimine if --test was used in call, get root directory and patterns list:
#check for test:
cmd=$(which $0)
#echo "Command: ""$cmd"
if [[ "$1" == --test ]]; then
	testing=true
	shift
	echo "\"--test\" was chosen. Nothing will be removed."				
else 
	testing=false
fi
#get root directory (above use of shift means it is now the first argument):
rootdir="$1"
#echo $rootdir
absrootdir=$(cd "$rootdir"; pwd)
#echo $absrootdir
#get list of patterns:
shift #ensures remaining args should be patterns, allowing use of mapping

#3 checking that the passed directory exists and is a directory:
if [[ ! -d "$absrootdir" ]]; then
	echo "ROOT_DIRECTORY argument is not a valid directory: $rootdir"
	exit 1
else
	cd "$absrootdir"
fi

#4 loop through the entries in the directory:
for file in * .*; do
	#4.a if entry is a regular file, determine if it matches one of 
		#the supplied filename patterns
	for pattern in "$@"; do
		if [[ "$file" == $pattern && "$file" != . && "$file" != .. ]]; then
			if $testing; then
				echo "Matched:""$file"
			else 
				if rm --force "$file" &> /dev/null; then
					echo "Deleted:""$file"
				else
					echo "Deletion failed:""$file"
				fi
				
			fi
			break
